    <h1>About</h1>
    <br />
    <p>This project involves building a ticket management system that integrates a backend with MongoDB for storage, Elasticsearch for fast search capabilities, and a frontend built with Angular for user interaction. The backend is constructed using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on tickets. These operations include creating, reading, updating, and deleting tickets in both MongoDB and Elasticsearch to ensure data consistency and fast search responses.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The frontend is built with Angular, leveraging PrimeNG for UI components. It features functionalities such as listing tickets with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. Users can create new tickets, edit existing ones, and delete tickets. The UI dynamically updates to reflect changes in the data, providing a responsive user experience. Special attention is given to efficient search operations, allowing users to quickly find relevant tickets using Elasticsearchâ€™s powerful querying capabilities.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Integration between the frontend and backend is facilitated by Angular services making HTTP requests to the Express.js APIs. Error handling, data validation, and user feedback mechanisms are implemented to ensure robustness and usability. The system also includes features like search-as-you-type, leveraging Elasticsearch's multi-match queries to provide instant search results.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The project emphasizes best practices in full-stack development, including modular code structure, clear separation of concerns, and scalable architecture. Logging and debugging techniques are applied to ensure smooth operation and maintenance. This setup provides a comprehensive and efficient ticket management solution, capable of handling real-time data updates and searches, ensuring both performance and user satisfaction.</p>
